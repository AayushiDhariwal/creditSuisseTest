To execute EventLogMapper, you  need to pass the correct filename with path in command line arguments.

If path is not passed, by default the code will search the file in WorkingDirectory/file.txt
For example, if logAnalysis.txt is the filename and project's working directory is C:\test\log_mapper
    The filepath will be - C:\test\log_mapper\logAnalysis.txt

JDK 11 and HSQLDB 2.6.0 is used
